title: What is Stretch?
peek: Nutshell-style expandable content
---

**Stretch** is a display mode inspired by [Nutshell](https://ncase.me/nutshell/). It creates expandable inline "bubbles" that smoothly animate open when clicked.

This content can contain other [nested stretches](node:stretch-nested?display=stretch) which will also expand inline!
