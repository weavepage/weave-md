**Recursion** is when something contains a reference to itself. In programming, it's a function that calls itself.

To understand recursion, you must first understand [recursion](node:stretch-recursion-meta?display=stretch).

A classic example is the [factorial function](node:stretch-factorial?display=stretch).
