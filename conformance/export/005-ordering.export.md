# Appendix Ordering Test

References in order:
1. [Third](#ordering-third)
2. [First](#ordering-first)
3. [Second](#ordering-second)
4. [First again](#ordering-first)

The appendix should preserve first-reference order, with deduplication.

---

## Appendix

### Third Referenced {#ordering-third}

This was referenced first in the main content, so should appear first in appendix.

### First Referenced {#ordering-first}

This was referenced second but should appear first in appendix (after third).

### Second Referenced {#ordering-second}

This was referenced third in the main content.
